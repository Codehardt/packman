# Java Pacman

I developed this Pacman Version when I was 16.

## Run the game

```
javac Packman.java
java Packman
```

## The Field

The Field can be dynamically changed by editing the text file in the res/ directory. Every char describes one element:

| Char  | Type            |
| ----- | --------------- |
| A     | Border 1        |
| B     | Border 2        |
| C    Â | Corner 1        |
| D     | Corner 2        |
| E     | Corner 3        |
| F     | Corner 4        |
| G     | Double Corner 1 |
| H     | Double Corner 2 |
| I     | Double Corner 3 |
| J     | Double Corner 4 |
| K     | Crisscross      |
| L     | Nothing         |
| M     | Feed            |
| N     | Packman         |
| 0     | Enemy           |
